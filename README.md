## 📖 Overview

Customer segmentation is a key marketing strategy where customers are divided into distinct groups based on similarities. In this project:

* We perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* Use **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis
* Apply clustering algorithms like **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical Clustering**
* Visualize the results to interpret customer clusters meaningfully

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 🐍
* **Libraries**:

  * `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
  * `scikit-learn` – Machine Learning algorithms
  * `plotly`, `yellowbrick` – Advanced visualization (optional)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * Clean missing/null values
   * Normalize data
   * Feature extraction (e.g. RFM values)

2. **EDA**:

   * Visualize customer spending patterns
   * Analyze distribution of key metrics

3. **Clustering**:

   * Determine optimal number of clusters using Elbow & Silhouette methods
   * Segment customers using K-Means
   * Visualize clusters using PCA/t-SNE

4. **Interpretation**:

   * Label each cluster based on characteristics (e.g., High-Value, Low-Engagement)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KardamSinghal/CustomerSegmentation.git
cd CustomerSegmentation
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the notebook

Open and execute the `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` notebook inside the `notebooks/` folder.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

* Incorporate **demographic features** for deeper segmentation
* Build an interactive **dashboard** using Streamlit or Dash
* Apply **dimensionality reduction** for better cluster separation
* Extend to **time-series behavior analysis**
